P1-V.1
======
Here is a link to the mock up site http://mbolger.github.io/P1-V.1/

This is project 1 for the Udacity Nano degree cohort #1. I used HTML CSS Javascript and bootstrap in this poroject. The goal was to create an dynamic website around a mock up provided for us in the course. This site will be updated frequently during my time in the nano degree program.
